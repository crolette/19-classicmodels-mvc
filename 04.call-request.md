# Call request

We will improve the way we call the products in the index.php. 


Previously, we had that: 

```php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', '1');
error_reporting(E_ALL);


require_once "connexion.php";


$statement = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM products");

$statement->execute();

$products = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);


foreach ($products as $product) {
	echo "<li>" . $product["productName"] . "</li>";
}
```

This code need to be updated. For example, catch an error if the request is not good, retreive only data we need, separate html and php. Let's do this. 


## Catch error

Like in the connexion file, we have to use a *try catch* when we make a request: 

```php
try {
	$statement = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM products");

	$statement->execute();

} catch(Exception $e) {

  echo $e->getMessage();
  exit;

}

$products = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

NB: I wrote the fetchAll after the *try catch*, because if we had a problem with the execution of the request, it should arrived in the preprare or execute stage. 

NB: Other remark, This *try catch* is written at the top of my file, before we write de the html. 

## Improve the request

We don't need all the columns from the product table, so, we will just select the accurate columns: 

```php
$statement = $db->prepare("SELECT productName, productCode FROM products");
```

## Display the datas 

Now we will display the datas in the html part (I give you the complete code): 

```php
<?php
	include "includes/header.php";
?>

	<main>
		<h1>Classic Models</h1>

	  <ol>
	      <?php
	          //display the datas
	          foreach($products as $product) : ?>

	          <li>
	              <a href="product.php?code=<?php echo $product["productCode"]; ?>">
	              	<h3><?php echo $product["productName"];?></h3>
	              </a>
	          </li>

	      <?php
	          endforeach;
	      ?>
	  </ol>
	</main>
<?php
    include "includes/footer.php";
?>
```

Note that, I grabbed the title of each product inside a link tag, because we will use it later. 


Let's improve this a little bit more: 

```php
<?php
	include "includes/header.php";
?>

<h1>Classic Models</h1>

    <ol>
        <?php
            //display the datas
            foreach($products as $product) : ?>

            <li>
                <a href="product.php?code=<?= $product["productCode"]; ?>">
                	<h3><?= $product["productName"];?></h3>
                </a>
            </li>

        <?php
            endforeach;
        ?>
    </ol>

<?php
    include "includes/footer.php";
?>
```

I changed the echo expression with the shortcut `<?=`, it's the same as `<?php echo`.
