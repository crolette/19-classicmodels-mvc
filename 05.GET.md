# GET

In the index.php, if you click on a product title, you'll be redirect to the `product.php` file. 

So, create this file with the error handling and the require to the connexion.php file. 

The goal here is to display only one product. 

I already give you the html part (copy-paste it): 

```php
include "includes/header.php";
?>

    <main>
        <h1><?= $product["productName"]; ?></h1>

        <h2>Price: <?= $product["buyPrice"]?> $</h2>

        <h2><?php echo strip_tags("<h2>attention</h2>"); ?></h2>

    </main>

<?php
    include "includes/footer.php";
?>
```

## Check `$_GET`

First of all, we have to check the GET we have in the url. The url should look like this : `localhost/Classic_models/product.php?code=S10_1678`. 

After the `?` you have the *$_GET* variable with the property *code*. 

To use it in PHP, you can write `$_GET["code"]`. 

### empty() or isset()

A common use is to check if the `$_GET["code"]` exists. For that, we can use the functions `empty()` or `isset()`. These functions return a boolean. 

`empty()` checks if a variable is not empty. 

For example, in our case, if `$_GET["code"]` is empty, print a message : 

```php
if(empty($_GET["code"])) {
    echo "url incorrect";
    exit;
}
```

`isset()` checks if a variable exists. 

In our case, if `$_GET["code"]` doesn't exist, print a message : 
```php
if(!isset($_GET["code"])){ 
	echo "url incorrect";
  exit;
}
```

It is important to prevent any issue with the user, so use it ! 

## Query with **$_GET**

So, we need to request a product from the products table base on its productCode. The query should look like this : 

```SQL
SELECT productName, buyPrice FROM products WHERE productCode = {$_GET["code"]}
```

And so, based on the query on the index.php page, the complete query may look like this: 

```php
try {
    $q = $db->prepare("SELECT productName, buyPrice FROM products WHERE productCode = {$_GET["code"]}");

    $q->execute();

} catch(PDOException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
    exit;
}

$product = $q->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```


Even if this code could work, we face here a security issue.

Guess which one? 


ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ We collect an info from the url, the `?code=` and we inject it directly in a request to the database. This can lead to an malicious SQL injection ! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ 

You have to have in mind that any data transmitted from the outside of your code is suspicious. 

So, before to make execute the query, we must verify if the `$_GET["code"]` is correct. 

### bindParam()

We will change the query like that : 

```php 
$q = $db->prepare("SELECT productName, buyPrice FROM products WHERE productCode = :codeProduct");
```

We changed the `$_GET["code"]` with the parameter `:codeProduct`. 

We will bind the GET variable to this parameter using the method `bindParam()`. This method allow us to check is the GET is ok to add in a query to the DB. 

The simple way to write is like that: 

```php 
$q->bindParam(":codeProduct", $_GET["code"]);
```

So, we replace the parameter with the variable GET. 

`bindParam()` returns a boolean. 

But `bindParam()` can hold more arguments. Check it out: https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindparam.php

As third argument, you can specify the type the variable has to return: a bloolean, a number, a string...

Here, we except that `$_GET["code"]` is a string, otherwise, the request cannot be send. 

So, we will write the binParam like that: 

```php
$q->bindParam(":codeProduct", $_GET["code"], PDO::PARAM_STR);
```

Now, we secured the query. We can execute it.
